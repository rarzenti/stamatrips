## Thursday, July 31

The midnight arrival had paid off! Marsha woke me up around 6:55AM for our 7AM bike ride. This was the first time Marsh and I have ridden our bikes this summer. We pumped up the tires and headed to the boardwalk.

Weather was beautiful, nice and warm! Got an iced coffee and sat there for a while. We biked home, I relaxed on the couch while Marsha went for a run. After a while, we ate some breakfast, went to pick up some beer, then it was time fo da beach!!!

Got screened up, waited for the girls, then headed down. Unlike last year, the water was beautiful. For some reason, I didn’t go into the water much. I was content chilling in the beach chair. Instead of drinking 10 beers, I opted for a nice (extra large) water.

Luke, Kenz and co. arrived shortly after we got to the beach and joined us about 1 hour later. Troy was being an absolute legend in his kiddy pool and Perry was doing her thing. She left the beach after a while to get a shower which Marsha said was an event.

We felt some raindrops so decided to pack it up a bit earlier than usual. We went back up around 4PM, showered up, and started preparing for dinner. We had a wonderful and nutritious spread. My diet for the past month has been devoid of any nutrients so this was fantastic.

Helen made some zucchini with a cucumber and tomato salad. Paul made some chicken legs on the grill which were fantastic, as always. A small storm rolled in but was brief.

During dinner, Manny downloaded ChatGPT and started writing poetry about Troy sleeping in the laundry, amongst other things. Helen also made an apple pie with farm fresh apples.

After dinner, we watched *Field of Dreams* on the TV, then played Codenames before bed. Teams were Marsha, Helen and myself vs. Luke, Kenz and Joan. I always enjoy playing Codenames.

We wrapped up around 10PM then went to bed shortly thereafter. I would call day 1 a complete success!
