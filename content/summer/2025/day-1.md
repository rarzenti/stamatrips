## Wednesday, July 30

**Beach time!!!** As per the usual, work has been kicking my butt 24/7 so this is the most needed vacation of my entire life. The plan was for Marsha and I to work, then go grab Joan around 5PM to depart for the beach house. We stuck to the plan which was fantastic.

I completely slacked off all day at work. I ended up meeting up with my mom for lunch at Panera Bread, then headed to Sam’s Club to pick up a few odds and ends. I hadn’t seen my mom in a while, so it was very nice.

Once I got home, I did a few hours of work to button some things up before the trip, then proceeded to get my haircut. Beth (absolute legend) did a great job as always. Something about a haircut really makes my days better.

Got home from the haircut, loaded up the trucks and bike rack (which my mom kindly brought to lunch for me) then snagged Joan from her brand spankin’ new apartment. Poor Joan has loud upstairs neighbors…

Anyway, left around 5:15. The girls took a nap (surprise, surprise) but only for about 45 minutes. The trip was straightforward. Listened to the *Call Her Daddy* podcast with Dave Franco which seemed to last for 4 hours (it was only 1 hour). Had a bit of rain but all together uneventful.

I picked the wrong side of the toll booth section and had to speak to a toll attendant for the first time in years. We got to the beach house around midnight, unpacked, and went to bed.
